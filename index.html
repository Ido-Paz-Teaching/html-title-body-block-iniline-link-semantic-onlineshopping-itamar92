  Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet
   using a web browser or a mobile app.Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly 
   or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability
    and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, 
    including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.

    An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another businesses, the process is called business-to-business (B2B) online shopping.
